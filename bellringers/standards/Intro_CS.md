# Intro to Computer Science Standards

This file contains the standards for Intro CS courses. You can replace this file with your own standards in the same format.

## Format

Each standard should be formatted as:

```markdown
## STANDARD-CODE
Description of what the standard covers
```

## Example Standards

## 1A-AP-08
Model daily processes by creating and following algorithms (sets of step-by-step instructions) to complete tasks.

## 1A-AP-09
Model the way programs store and manipulate data by using numbers or other symbols to represent information.

## 1A-AP-10
Develop programs with sequences and simple loops, to express ideas or address a problem.

## 1A-AP-11
Decompose (break down) the steps needed to solve a problem into a precise sequence of instructions.

## 1A-AP-12
Develop plans that describe a program's sequence of events, goals, and expected outcomes.

## 1A-AP-14
Debug (identify and fix) errors in an algorithm or program that includes sequences and simple loops.

## 1A-AP-15
Using correct terminology, describe steps taken and choices made during the iterative process of program development.

**To use your own standards:**
1. Replace this file with your standards document
2. Keep the same format (## CODE followed by description)
3. The system will automatically parse and use your standards
